# Hacker News toolset

## Toolset purpose

Give a coding agent bounded, task-shaped read access to Hacker News content so
it can perform the eight documented agent outcomes in `docs/use-cases.md`:
summarise feeds (front page, Show/Ask/Job), expand a single item, reconstruct a
comment thread, profile a user, poll for changes, monitor keywords client-side,
and compute client-side analytics over a fetched set.

The toolset wraps the official read-only Firebase JSON API
(`https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/`, see `docs/service-research.md`). That
upstream is a low-level identity store: every feed is a bare array of item ids,
and every item must be fetched one id at a time. The agent-facing value of this
toolset is therefore **fan-out compression with explicit bounds**: a single tool
call resolves a feed-of-ids-plus-N-item-fetches into one normalized, capped,
observable result, instead of forcing the agent to orchestrate dozens of raw id
lookups by hand.

Every tool is read-only. The Hacker News API documents no write, vote, post, or
moderation endpoint, so this toolset cannot mutate anything; that is a property
of the upstream, not an omission (see [Out of scope](#out-of-scope)).

## Agent contract

- **Pick the task tool, not the endpoint.** To see "what's on HN right now" use
  `stories.list`; to read a discussion use `threads.get`; to look up one known
  id use `items.get`. Only reach for the raw change feeds (`updates.get`,
  `items.recent`) when monitoring for change.
- **Everything that fans out is bounded.** Feeds, threads, and submission
  hydration are capped by hard limits and never return unbounded upstream arrays
  (`kids`, `submitted`) in full. When a result is capped you get a `truncated`
  flag and a `requested_limits` / `actual_counts` pair so you can detect and
  page past the boundary yourself.
- **`null` upstream is not an error for fan-out members.** A missing/deleted item
  inside a feed or thread is skipped and counted, not fatal. A missing **root**
  resource (the item, user, or feed you directly asked for) is a `not_found`.
- **Reads are live, not stable.** No read is idempotent: scores, comment counts,
  edits, `dead`/`deleted` flags, feeds, and the change feeds all move over time.
  Treat every result as a snapshot; re-call to refresh.
- **Text is raw HTML.** `title`, `text`, `about`, and `url` are passed through
  exactly as Hacker News returns them (HTML markup and entities **not** decoded
  or sanitised). Strip/escape on the agent side before display.
- **Search, filtering, and analytics are your job.** The API has no search; for
  keyword/domain monitoring and aggregates, fetch a set with these tools and
  filter/aggregate client-side (use cases #7 and #8).
- **Timestamps are native `Date`s.** Unix-seconds (`time`, `created`) are
  converted to `Date` objects (`posted_at`, `created_at`); do not expect epoch
  integers.

## Resource and concept model

Hacker News has exactly two identified resources plus three derived feeds:

- **Item** — the universal content node. One integer `id`; a `type` field
  discriminates `story | comment | job | poll | pollopt`. Stories, Ask HN, Show
  HN, jobs, polls, poll options, and comments are all items. Fields are present
  only when applicable (HN omits empty/false fields). `kids` holds direct child
  comment ids in ranked display order; full threads require recursive fetches.
- **User** — a profile keyed by a **case-sensitive** username string. Carries
  `karma`, `created`, optional `about`, and a `submitted` id list (newest first,
  can be thousands long).
- **Ranked feeds** — `top`, `new`, `best`, `ask`, `show`, `job`: bare arrays of
  item ids in ranked order (≤500 for top/new/best, ≤200 for ask/show/job).
- **maxitem** — the current largest item id (a bare integer); walking ids
  downward from it discovers brand-new items of any type.
- **updates** — a change feed `{ items: id[], profiles: username[] }` of recently
  changed items and profiles.

### Canonical normalized `Item`

`items.get`, the root of `threads.get`, each of `users.get`'s
`recent_submissions`, and each of `items.recent`'s `items` share **one** stable
shape. Fields marked required are always present; `?` fields are **omitted**
(absent from the object) when the upstream omits them — they are never `null`.

```ts
type ItemType = "story" | "comment" | "job" | "poll" | "pollopt" | "unknown";

interface Item {
  id: number;            // required — the upstream id (echoes the request)
  type: ItemType;        // required — "unknown" only if upstream omits `type`
  by?: string;           // author username; omitted on deleted items
  posted_at?: Date;      // native Date from `time`*1000; omitted if no `time`
  title?: string;        // story/poll/job title (raw HTML); omitted otherwise
  url?: string;          // story/job target; omitted otherwise; may be "" for jobs
  text?: string;         // comment/ask/job/pollopt body (raw HTML); omitted otherwise
  score?: number;        // points, or a pollopt's votes; omitted if absent
  descendants?: number;  // total comment count (story/poll); omitted otherwise
  kids_count: number;    // required — count of direct child comments (0 if none)
  parent?: number;       // comment/pollopt: parent item id; omitted otherwise
  poll?: number;         // pollopt: parent poll id; omitted otherwise
  part_ids?: number[];   // poll: pollopt ids in display order; omitted otherwise
  deleted: boolean;      // required — true only if upstream `deleted` is true
  dead: boolean;         // required — true only if upstream `dead` is true
}
```

- **Nullability:** optional fields are omitted, never `null`. The four required
  fields (`id`, `type`, `kids_count`, `deleted`, `dead`) are always present.
- **`kids` is never returned as an array** by `Item`; only `kids_count`. The raw
  `kids` list can be large and unbounded — thread traversal goes through
  `threads.get`, which bounds it. `part_ids` *is* returned in full because poll
  option counts are inherently tiny (single digits), so it carries no unbounded
  fan-out risk.
- **`url` empty string** (jobs sometimes have `url: ""`) is preserved as `""`,
  distinct from omitted.

## Authentication

**None — and the toolset must send none.** The Hacker News API is fully public
and unauthenticated: no API keys, bearer tokens, OAuth, cookies, or credential
query/headers exist or are accepted. There is no credential to inject and
nothing to read from the environment.

Contract consequence for tests: every host-call assertion checks that requests
carry **no** `Authorization` header and no credential query parameter. Adding
auth would be a defect, not a feature.

## Global bounds and error policy

**Host.** Exactly one host is contacted: `hacker-news.firebaseio.com`. It is the
only entry in the manifest's `allowed_hosts`. No other host (including the
separate Algolia HN Search service) is reachable from the sandbox.

**Request shape.** Every upstream call is `GET https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/…json`.
The optional `?print=pretty` formatting flag is **never** sent (it changes only
whitespace). No request body, no custom headers.

**Retries / determinism.** No automatic retries. Each logical fetch maps to
exactly one host call, so call-count and call-order assertions are exact. A
transient upstream failure surfaces as `upstream_error` (root) or a counted
`failed_fetch` (fan-out member) rather than being silently retried.

**Pagination.** The upstream has no cursors, `limit`, `offset`, or `page`
params — id lists are returned whole. This toolset paginates **client-side**:
`stories.list` exposes `offset`+`limit` slicing over the ranked id array;
`threads.get` bounds by depth + node budget; `users.get` and `items.recent`
bound by a hydration count. No tool ever fetches a feed's full id array as
output.

**Error taxonomy.** Tools signal failure by throwing `Error` whose message is
`"<code>: <detail>"`. Three codes, stable across all tools:

| Code | Meaning | When |
|------|---------|------|
| `validation_error` | Caller-side bad input | Detected **before any** host call; the failing tool makes **zero** upstream requests. |
| `not_found` | A **root** resource does not exist | The directly-requested item / user returned the JSON literal `null` (HTTP 200, null body). |
| `upstream_error` | Generic upstream failure | A **root** request returned non-2xx, a non-JSON body, or an unexpected shape (e.g. a feed endpoint that did not return an array). |

`null` / `deleted` / `dead` / per-item non-2xx for a **fan-out member** (a feed
story, a thread comment, a hydrated submission) is **never** fatal: the member is
skipped and tallied (see counts below), and the tool returns a partial result.

**Truncation & accounting (every fan-out tool).** Bounded, sliced, recursive, or
fan-out tools return two stable accounting objects in **both** full and partial
results, plus (where an ordered slice applies) a `truncated` boolean:

- `requested_limits` — echoes the effective bounds actually used (after
  defaulting/clamping), so the agent sees what was asked.
- `actual_counts` — what happened, with the invariant that the selected-id count
  equals the sum of returned + each skip/fail bucket. The feed-list / profile /
  maxitem **root** lookups are *not* counted as items; only resolved member
  records and their skip/fail buckets are. Each tool's section defines its exact
  fields and which of {root lookups, hydrated records, null, deleted/dead, failed
  fetch} each bucket includes.
- `truncated` — `true` when more ordered upstream ids existed beyond what was
  returned (so the agent can page or widen bounds).

**Effects.** Every tool is `@effect readOnly` (no side effects; in particular
`updates.get` does **not** advance any cursor, consume events, or take a lease —
it is a plain read of HN's change snapshot). **No tool is `@idempotent`**: the
backing data is mutable and the change feeds move every poll, so an earlier
result cannot be reused in place of a refetch.

**Native types.** Timestamps are `Date`. All other fields are primitives, arrays
of primitives, or the objects defined here. No JSON stand-ins (no epoch-int
"dates", no stringified numbers). This makes the tools codemode-only, which is
the intended invocation path.

**File layout and shared helpers (tool rule 10).** The six entry files are named
`{resource}.{method}.ts`: `tools/items.get.ts`, `tools/stories.list.ts`,
`tools/threads.get.ts`, `tools/users.get.ts`, `tools/updates.get.ts`,
`tools/items.recent.ts`. Logic common to all of them lives in one helper module
included via `additionalTypeScriptGlobs` (e.g. `"additionalTypeScriptGlobs":
["lib/**/*.ts"]` in `toolbox.devpkg.json`) — never copied per file:

- `fetchJson(path)` — issues the single `GET https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com{path}`,
  maps non-2xx → `upstream_error`, parses JSON, returns the value (including
  `null`). No retries, no `?print=pretty`, no headers.
- `normalizeItem(raw)` — the upstream-item → canonical [`Item`](#canonical-normalized-item)
  projection (`time`→`posted_at` `Date`, `kids`→`kids_count`, `parts`→`part_ids`,
  default flags/`type`, omit absent fields).
- `err(code, detail)` — constructs the `"<code>: <detail>"` `Error` for the three
  taxonomy codes.
- Count/accounting helpers maintaining the `requested_limits` / `actual_counts`
  invariants and the skip/fail bucket classification shared by every fan-out tool.

Entry files stay thin (validate → call helpers → assemble result). Each carries a
single `@effect readOnly` JSDoc tag and **no** `@idempotent` tag (rules 8–9).
Descriptions are omitted where `{resource}.{method}` plus the typed signature
already explains the tool (rules 1–2); only a non-obvious bound or behaviour
earns a comment.

## Out of scope

Each exclusion is a property of the upstream API (per `docs/service-research.md`),
not a deferred feature:

- **All writes** — posting, commenting, voting, flagging, favoriting, editing
  profiles. The API documents **no** create/update/delete endpoint; it is
  read-only. There are no idempotency keys or transactions because there are no
  writes. (Those actions exist only on the HN website.)
- **Server-side search / filter / sort / date-range / author query** — the API
  offers none. (Full-text search lives in the separate Algolia HN Search service
  on a different host, which is intentionally **not** in `allowed_hosts`.)
  Keyword/domain monitoring (use case #7) is done agent-side over fetched items.
- **Aggregate analytics endpoints** — none exist; trends/score-distributions/
  domain-counts (use case #8) are computed agent-side from items these tools
  return.
- **Batch / bulk item fetch** — no multi-id endpoint; fan-out tools fetch ids
  individually (and bound the count).
- **Webhooks / realtime push / Firebase streaming subscriptions** — out of scope
  by design; this is a request/response polling toolset. Change observation is
  via `updates.get` / `items.recent` polling only.
- **Unbounded array retrieval** — the full `kids` tree and the full `submitted`
  list (thousands of ids) are never returned whole; bounded summaries/counts are
  returned instead.
- **HTML sanitisation / entity decoding** — fields are raw HTML passthrough; the
  toolset performs no decoding so behaviour stays faithful and testable.

## Tool inventory

| Tool | Agent outcome (use case) | Upstream endpoints | Effect | Worst-case host calls |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------|-----------------------|
| `items.get` | Expand one item by id (#3) | `item/{id}` | readOnly | 1 |
| `stories.list` | Front page & Show/Ask/Job feeds; analytics source (#1, #2, #7, #8) | `{kind}stories` + `item/{id}`×N | readOnly | 1 + limit (≤ 31) |
| `threads.get` | Story + comment-thread report (#4) | `item/{id}` (root + recursive comments) | readOnly | 1 + max_nodes (≤ 201) |
| `users.get` | Profile a user; optional recent submissions (#5) | `user/{name}` + `item/{id}`×N | readOnly | 1 + include_recent (≤ 31) |
| `updates.get` | Lightweight change feed (#6) | `updates` | readOnly | 1 |
| `items.recent` | Discover brand-new items via count-down (#6) | `maxitem` + `item/{id}`×N | readOnly | 1 + 2·limit (≤ 61) |

No tool is `@idempotent` (live mutable data). All read from one host.

## Tools

### items.get

**Purpose.** Resolve a single Hacker News item of any type (story, comment, job,
poll, pollopt) by its numeric id into the canonical normalized [`Item`](#canonical-normalized-item).

**Use when** the agent already has an item id — from an HN URL
(`news.ycombinator.com/item?id=…`), from a feed/thread result, from a user's
submissions, or from `updates.get` — and wants that one record. Foundational
deep-link/lookup (use case #3).

**Do not use when** you need a story's discussion (use `threads.get`), a whole
feed (use `stories.list`), or to discover ids you don't yet have (use
`stories.list`, `updates.get`, or `items.recent`).

**Inputs.**

| Name | Type | Default | Validation |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| `id` | `number` | — (required) | Integer `> 0`; else `validation_error` with **zero** host calls. |

**Output.** The canonical [`Item`](#canonical-normalized-item) (single object).
Not a fan-out tool — exactly one host call, no slicing — so it carries **no**
`requested_limits` / `actual_counts` / `truncated`. `deleted`/`dead` items are
**returned** (with `deleted`/`dead` set and content fields omitted) rather than
skipped, because the caller asked for that specific id and the flags are the
answer.

**Bounds and truncation.** None — a single fetch. `kids_count` is returned but
the `kids` array is not (use `threads.get` to walk it).

**Upstream call plan and transformations.**

1. `GET /v0/item/{id}.json`.
2. Map fields: `time`→`posted_at` (`new Date(time*1000)`); `kids`→`kids_count`
   (`kids.length`, else 0); `parts`→`part_ids`; `deleted`/`dead` default `false`;
   `type` default `"unknown"`. Omit every field the upstream omits. `title` /
   `text` / `url` / `about` are passed through as raw HTML.

**Branch and error behaviour.**

- `id` not a positive integer → `validation_error`, no host call.
- Body is JSON `null` → `not_found: no item with id {id}`.
- Non-2xx response → `upstream_error: Hacker News API returned {status}`.
- Otherwise → normalized `Item`, including the deleted/dead branches.

**Test grounding (fixtures + host-call assertions).**

- *ok (story)* — fixture `item/8863.json` → assert one call
  `GET hacker-news.firebaseio.com /v0/item/8863.json`; output contains the title,
  `by`, `kids_count`, and `posted_at` as a `Date` (`2007-04-04T19:16:40Z`).
  (Existing `tests/cases/items.get.ok.json`.)
- *comment / poll / pollopt* — fixtures for ids `2921983` (comment: asserts
  `parent`, `text`, no `title`), `126809` (poll: asserts `part_ids`,
  `descendants`), `160705` (pollopt: asserts `poll`, `score`).
- *not_found* — fixture returns `null` → `errorContains: "not_found"`. (Existing
  `tests/cases/items.get.missing.json`.)
- *bad id* — `id: -4` → `errorContains: "validation_error"`, `calls: []`.
  (Existing `tests/cases/items.get.bad-id.json`.)
- *upstream_error* — fixture status `500` → `errorContains: "upstream_error"`.
- *no-credentials* — every fixture asserts no `Authorization` header is sent.

**Implementation notes.** Trivial single fetch; shares `fetchJson` +
`normalizeItem` helpers (see [shared helpers](#shared-helpers)). `id` is
embedded in the path; reject non-integers before building the URL so a bad id
can never produce a host call.

---

### stories.list

**Purpose.** Compress "fetch a ranked feed, then resolve N ids into records" into
one bounded call. Covers the front page (`top`/`best`/`new`) and the category
feeds (`ask`/`show`/`job`) — use cases #1 and #2 — and is the standard source set
for client-side keyword monitoring (#7) and analytics (#8).

**Use when** the agent wants the current ranked contents of a feed: top stories,
best stories, newest stories, latest Show HN / Ask HN / job posts.

**Do not use when** you want a single known id (`items.get`), a discussion
(`threads.get`), or the change feed (`updates.get`). Note the `top` feed mixes in
job posts (each tagged via `type`); filter client-side if you want stories only.
For the full body of an Ask HN post, call `items.get` on the story id — list
summaries omit `text` to stay bounded.

**Inputs.**

| Name | Type | Default | Validation |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| `kind` | `"top"\|"new"\|"best"\|"ask"\|"show"\|"job"` | `"top"` | Must be one of the six; else `validation_error`, no host calls. |
| `limit` | `number` | `10` | Integer `1..30`; else `validation_error`, no host calls. |
| `offset` | `number` | `0` | Integer `>= 0`; else `validation_error`, no host calls. Offset beyond the feed length yields an empty `stories` with `truncated: false`. |

Feed → endpoint: `top`→`topstories`, `new`→`newstories`, `best`→`beststories`,
`ask`→`askstories`, `show`→`showstories`, `job`→`jobstories`.

**Output.**

```ts
interface StoryListResult {
  kind: "top" | "new" | "best" | "ask" | "show" | "job";  // echoes input
  requested_limits: {
    limit: number;   // effective limit (after defaulting; 1..30)
    offset: number;  // effective offset (>= 0)
  };
  actual_counts: {
    feed_ids_available: number;       // ids the feed endpoint returned (the root list; not "items")
    ids_selected: number;             // ids in the offset..offset+limit slice (<= limit)
    stories_returned: number;         // hydrated records in `stories`
    skipped_deleted_or_dead: number;  // selected ids whose item was deleted/dead
    skipped_null: number;             // selected ids whose item body was null
    failed_fetch: number;             // selected ids whose item fetch returned non-2xx
  };
  truncated: boolean;                 // feed_ids_available > offset + ids_selected
  stories: StorySummary[];            // ranked order == the feed id-list order
}

interface StorySummary {
  id: number;          // required
  type: ItemType;      // required — disambiguates job vs story in mixed feeds
  title?: string;      // omitted if upstream omits
  url?: string;        // omitted (self/Ask posts have none); may be ""
  by?: string;         // omitted if absent
  score?: number;      // omitted if absent
  posted_at?: Date;    // native Date; omitted if no `time`
  comments: number;    // required — `descendants ?? 0`
}
```

- **Count invariant:** `ids_selected = stories_returned + skipped_deleted_or_dead
  + skipped_null + failed_fetch`. The single feed-list call is **not** counted in
  any of these (it is the root, not an item).
- **Ordering:** `stories` preserves feed rank (the id-list order) with skipped
  ids removed; never re-sorted.
- **Max items:** `stories.length <= limit <= 30`.
- **Omission:** deleted/dead/null/failed ids are absent from `stories` and
  recorded in the matching count bucket — never emitted as placeholders.
- **Summary is lean** by design: no `text`, `kids_count`, or linkage fields (use
  `items.get`/`threads.get` for those).

**Bounds and truncation.** Hard cap `limit <= 30` ⇒ at most `1 + 30 = 31` host
calls. `truncated` is `true` whenever ranked ids remain past `offset + limit`,
signalling the agent can page by raising `offset`.

**Upstream call plan and transformations.**

1. `GET /v0/{kind}stories.json` → array of ids; non-array body → `upstream_error`.
2. Slice `ids[offset : offset+limit]` → the selected ids.
3. For each selected id **in order**: `GET /v0/item/{id}.json`. Skip `null`
   (→`skipped_null`), `deleted`/`dead` (→`skipped_deleted_or_dead`); non-2xx →
   `failed_fetch` (skip, do not abort). Otherwise project to `StorySummary`
   (`time`→`posted_at`, `descendants ?? 0`→`comments`).
4. Assemble counts and `truncated = ids.length > offset + selected.length`.

**Branch and error behaviour.**

- Bad `kind` / `limit` / `offset` → `validation_error`, zero host calls.
- Feed list non-2xx or non-array → `upstream_error` (root failure; aborts).
- Empty feed or offset past end → `stories: []`, all counts 0, `truncated:
  false`. Not an error.
- Per-item failures are partial-result, never fatal (counted, see above).

**Test grounding (fixtures + host-call assertions).**

- *ok (ordered, truncated)* — feed `[101,102,103,104]`, `limit:2` → assert calls
  in exact order `topstories.json`, `item/101.json`, `item/102.json` (and **not**
  103/104); output contains both titles and `truncated: true`,
  `actual_counts.stories_returned: 2`. (Existing `tests/cases/stories.list.ok.json`.)
- *kind routing* — `kind:"show"` asserts the call hits `showstories.json`;
  one case per kind confirms the six-way map.
- *offset paging* — feed of 5 ids, `offset:2, limit:2` asserts calls for the 3rd
  and 4th ids and `truncated: true`.
- *skips* — among selected ids, one returns `null`, one `{deleted:true}`, one a
  `500`; assert `stories_returned`, `skipped_null`, `skipped_deleted_or_dead`,
  `failed_fetch` each `=1` and the count invariant holds.
- *bad limit* — `limit:500` → `errorContains:"validation_error"`, `calls:[]`.
  (Existing `tests/cases/stories.list.bad-limit.json`.)
- *empty feed* — feed `[]` → `stories:[]`, one call (`topstories.json`),
  `truncated:false`.
- *no-credentials* — assert no auth header on any call.

**Implementation notes.** Sequential ordered hydration keeps host-call order
exactly assertable (an implementation may parallelise a level as long as output
order and the call *set* are preserved). Shares `fetchJson` + `normalizeItem`.
`top`/`job` feeds legitimately contain jobs — surface `type`, never silently
drop them.

---

### threads.get

**Purpose.** Reconstruct the discussion under an item as a **bounded** nested
comment tree: fetch the root item, then walk its `kids` recursively within a
depth and node budget. Covers the story + comment-thread report (use case #4).

**Use when** the agent wants the conversation under a story/Ask/poll (or any item
with replies) to summarise or analyse — not just the top-line counts.

**Do not use when** you only need the root's own fields (`items.get`) or the
total comment count (it is `descendants` on the root). Threads can be enormous;
this tool intentionally returns a *bounded sample*, not the entire tree.

**Inputs.**

| Name | Type | Default | Validation |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| `root_id` | `number` | — (required) | Integer `> 0`; else `validation_error`, no host calls. |
| `max_depth` | `number` | `3` | Integer `0..6` (root is depth 0; comments start at depth 1); else `validation_error`. |
| `max_nodes` | `number` | `50` | Integer `1..200` (total comments fetched, excluding root); else `validation_error`. |

**Output.**

```ts
interface ThreadResult {
  root: Item;          // canonical normalized Item for root_id
  requested_limits: {
    max_depth: number; // effective depth bound
    max_nodes: number; // effective node budget
  };
  actual_counts: {
    nodes_fetched: number;            // comment items placed in the tree (excludes root)
    skipped_deleted_or_dead: number;  // comment ids whose item was deleted/dead (subtree pruned)
    skipped_null: number;             // comment ids whose body was null
    failed_fetch: number;             // comment fetches that returned non-2xx
    cycles_skipped: number;           // ids re-encountered via the visited guard (normally 0)
    max_depth_reached: number;        // deepest level actually materialised (0..max_depth)
  };
  truncated: boolean;  // true if the walk stopped with kids still unexpanded
  comments: Comment[]; // depth-1 comments in HN ranked order; each nests its replies
}

interface Comment {
  id: number;          // required
  by?: string;         // omitted on deleted comments
  posted_at?: Date;    // omitted if no `time`
  text?: string;       // raw HTML body; omitted if absent
  deleted: boolean;    // required
  dead: boolean;       // required
  depth: number;       // required — 1 for top-level, increasing with nesting
  kids_count: number;  // required — upstream direct-child count (may exceed replies.length when truncated)
  replies: Comment[];  // child comments actually fetched, HN ranked order; [] at the depth/node boundary
}
```

- **Count invariant:** every comment id dequeued during the walk lands in exactly
  one of `nodes_fetched`, `skipped_deleted_or_dead`, `skipped_null`,
  `failed_fetch`, or `cycles_skipped`. The root fetch is **not** counted (it is
  the root, returned as `root`).
- **Ordering:** children appear in upstream `kids` order (HN ranked order) at
  every level. Traversal is breadth-first so the budget favours the
  highest-ranked comments across the tree rather than draining into one subtree.
- **Max items:** `nodes_fetched <= max_nodes <= 200`; nesting depth `<= max_depth
  <= 6`.
- **Partial-result signal:** `truncated` is `true` if any node still had
  unexpanded `kids` when the depth bound or node budget was hit. At a node, a
  non-empty `kids_count` with a shorter `replies` array is the local truncation
  marker.

**Bounds and truncation.** Hard caps: `max_depth <= 6`, `max_nodes <= 200` ⇒ at
most `1 + 200 = 201` host calls. Lower `max_nodes` for latency; the result stays
correct, just smaller, with `truncated: true`. Cycles cannot inflate the budget:
a visited `Set` of ids guarantees each id is fetched at most once.

**Upstream call plan and transformations.**

1. `GET /v0/item/{root_id}.json` → root. `null` → `not_found`; non-2xx →
   `upstream_error`. Normalize to `Item`.
2. Seed a FIFO queue with the root's `kids` (depth 1), tracking depth per id and a
   visited `Set` seeded with `root_id`.
3. While the queue is non-empty **and** `nodes_fetched < max_nodes`: dequeue id;
   if already visited → `cycles_skipped`, continue; mark visited; `GET
   /v0/item/{id}.json`. Classify: `null`→`skipped_null`; `deleted`/`dead`→
   `skipped_deleted_or_dead` (its subtree is **pruned** — not enqueued); non-2xx→
   `failed_fetch`. Otherwise build a `Comment`, attach under its parent, and — if
   `depth < max_depth` — enqueue its `kids` at `depth+1`.
4. `truncated` = the queue was non-empty when the loop stopped, **or** any
   retained node had `kids_count > 0` beyond `max_depth`.

**Branch and error behaviour.**

- Bad `root_id` / `max_depth` / `max_nodes` → `validation_error`, zero host calls.
- Root `null` → `not_found: no item with id {root_id}`.
- Root non-2xx → `upstream_error`.
- Root has no `kids` (e.g. a comment with no replies, or `max_depth: 0`) →
  `comments: []`, `nodes_fetched: 0`, `truncated: false`.
- Per-comment null/deleted/dead/non-2xx → counted, walk continues (partial
  result). A deleted/dead comment's subtree is pruned (documented limitation:
  live replies nested under a since-deleted parent are not returned — matches use
  case #4's "skip deleted/dead").

**Test grounding (fixtures + host-call assertions).**

- *ok (nested, bounded)* — root `1` with `kids:[2,3]`, `2` with `kids:[4]`,
  `max_depth:2, max_nodes:10` → assert BFS call order `item/1`, `item/2`,
  `item/3`, `item/4`; output nests `4` under `2`, `nodes_fetched:3`,
  `truncated:false`.
- *node-budget truncation* — root with 5 kids, `max_nodes:2` → assert exactly
  `1 + 2 = 3` calls, `truncated:true`, and the two retained top-level comments
  have `kids_count` reflecting upstream while deeper kids are unfetched.
- *depth cap* — `max_depth:1` → asserts only depth-1 comments fetched; their
  `replies:[]` with positive `kids_count`; `truncated:true`.
- *skips* — a kid returns `{deleted:true}` (subtree pruned, asserted not
  enqueued), another returns `null`, another `500` → assert the three skip/fail
  buckets and that the walk continued.
- *root not_found* — root returns `null` → `errorContains:"not_found"`, one call.
- *bad bounds* — `max_nodes:9999` → `errorContains:"validation_error"`,
  `calls:[]`.
- *cycle guard* — a kid points back at the root id → `cycles_skipped:1`, no
  refetch of the root.
- *no-credentials* — assert no auth header on any call.

**Implementation notes.** Deterministic BFS dequeue order makes the host-call
sequence exactly assertable. Shares `fetchJson` + `normalizeItem`. The visited
`Set` is mandatory even though HN threads are acyclic in practice — it is the
documented cycle-handling guarantee and the only thing that bounds a malformed
tree. Keep traversal sequential in the contract; an implementation may fetch a
single BFS level concurrently provided per-level call sets and output ordering
are preserved.

### users.get

**Purpose.** Resolve a Hacker News user profile by username and, optionally,
hydrate their most-recent submissions into items so the agent can see *what* they
post. Covers profiling a user (use case #5).

**Use when** the agent has a username (from a story/comment `by`, from
`updates.get` `profiles`, or supplied directly) and wants karma, account age,
bio, and/or a sample of recent activity.

**Do not use when** you have an item id rather than a username (`items.get`) or
want feed-wide activity (`stories.list`). The full `submitted` list (potentially
thousands of ids) is **never** returned — only its length and up to
`include_recent` hydrated records.

**Inputs.**

| Name | Type | Default | Validation |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| `username` | `string` | — (required) | Non-empty after trim (case-sensitive, sent verbatim); else `validation_error`, no host calls. |
| `include_recent` | `number` | `0` | Integer `0..30`; `0` = profile only (one host call); else `validation_error`. |

**Output.**

```ts
interface UserResult {
  id: string;            // required — the username (case-sensitive, as upstream returns)
  created_at: Date;      // required — account creation (native Date)
  karma: number;         // required
  about?: string;        // raw HTML bio; omitted if absent
  submitted_count: number; // required — length of upstream `submitted` (0 if none)
  requested_limits: {
    include_recent: number;  // effective hydration count (0..30)
  };
  actual_counts: {
    submissions_requested: number;    // min(include_recent, submitted_count)
    submissions_returned: number;     // hydrated records in `recent_submissions`
    skipped_deleted_or_dead: number;
    skipped_null: number;
    failed_fetch: number;
  };
  recent_submissions: Item[];  // canonical Items, newest-first; [] when include_recent = 0
}
```

- **Count invariant:** `submissions_requested = submissions_returned +
  skipped_deleted_or_dead + skipped_null + failed_fetch`. The profile fetch is
  **not** counted (it is the root). `submitted_count` reflects the **whole**
  upstream list even though at most `include_recent` ids are ever fetched.
- **Ordering:** `recent_submissions` follows `submitted` order, which HN
  documents as newest-first; the first `include_recent` ids are taken and
  hydrated in that order.
- **Max items:** `recent_submissions.length <= include_recent <= 30`.
- **Shape:** each entry is the full canonical [`Item`](#canonical-normalized-item)
  (so comment submissions carry `text`/`parent`, story submissions carry
  `title`/`url`).

**Bounds and truncation.** Hard cap `include_recent <= 30` ⇒ at most `1 + 30 =
31` host calls. There is no `truncated` flag: the contract is "first N of
`submitted`", and `submitted_count` already tells the agent how many more exist
(`submitted_count - submissions_requested`). The unbounded `submitted` array is
never materialised.

**Upstream call plan and transformations.**

1. `GET /v0/user/{username}.json`. `null` → `not_found`; non-2xx →
   `upstream_error`. Map `created`→`created_at` (`Date`), copy `karma`, `about`
   (omit if absent), `submitted_count = (submitted?.length ?? 0)`.
2. If `include_recent > 0`: take `submitted.slice(0, include_recent)`; for each
   id **in order** `GET /v0/item/{id}.json`, classifying null/deleted-or-dead/
   non-2xx into the skip/fail buckets, else normalize to `Item`.

**Branch and error behaviour.**

- Empty/whitespace `username` or bad `include_recent` → `validation_error`, zero
  host calls.
- Profile `null` → `not_found: no user {username}`.
- Profile non-2xx → `upstream_error`.
- User with no `submitted` (or `include_recent: 0`) → `recent_submissions: []`,
  hydration counts 0, one host call.
- Per-submission failures → counted, partial result (never fatal).

**Test grounding (fixtures + host-call assertions).**

- *profile only* — `username:"jl"`, default `include_recent:0` → assert exactly
  one call `user/jl.json`; output has `karma`, `created_at` as a `Date`,
  `submitted_count`, and `recent_submissions: []`.
- *with hydration, ordered* — `submitted:[10,11,12]`, `include_recent:2` → assert
  calls `user/{name}.json`, `item/10.json`, `item/11.json` in that order (12 not
  fetched); `submissions_returned:2`, `submitted_count:3`.
- *case sensitivity* — `username:"JL"` and `"jl"` hit distinct paths
  `user/JL.json` vs `user/jl.json` (verbatim, no normalisation).
- *submission skips* — among hydrated ids one `null`, one `{dead:true}`, one
  `500` → assert the three buckets and the count invariant.
- *not_found* — profile `null` → `errorContains:"not_found"`, one call.
- *bad include_recent* — `include_recent:31` → `errorContains:"validation_error"`,
  `calls:[]`.
- *no-credentials* — assert no auth header on any call.

**Implementation notes.** Shares `fetchJson` + `normalizeItem`. Never read or
return the full `submitted` array beyond the `slice(0, include_recent)` window —
that is the bound that keeps a thousand-submission account cheap. Sequential
hydration keeps call order assertable.

### updates.get

**Purpose.** Return Hacker News's change feed — the ids of recently changed items
and the usernames of recently changed profiles — so an agent can poll for change
and re-fetch only what moved, instead of rescanning whole feeds. Covers the
lightweight change-feed half of use case #6 (and feeds keyword monitoring, #7).

**Use when** running a monitor loop: call periodically, diff against the prior
result, then re-hydrate the changed ids/usernames with `items.get` / `users.get`.

**Do not use when** you want ranked/front-page content (`stories.list`) or
brand-new items in creation order (`items.recent`). This tool **does not**
hydrate — it relays ids/usernames cheaply in one call; hydration is the agent's
choice.

**Inputs.** None.

**Output.**

```ts
interface UpdatesResult {
  item_ids: number[];   // required — recently changed item ids, upstream order; [] if none
  profiles: string[];   // required — recently changed usernames, upstream order; [] if none
  actual_counts: {
    item_ids: number;   // item_ids.length
    profiles: number;   // profiles.length
  };
}
```

- **Nullability:** both arrays are always present (possibly empty), never `null`.
- **Ordering:** exactly as the upstream `updates` payload returns them
  (no re-sort, no dedupe beyond what HN provides).
- **No hydration, so no `requested_limits`/`truncated`:** this is a single
  pass-through read, not a fan-out or sliced tool. `actual_counts` is included for
  observability (how much changed this poll). The arrays are **not** capped: the
  feed only holds *recently* changed entries (upstream-bounded), and silently
  slicing it would risk dropping a change the monitor must see — defeating the
  tool's purpose. (If the agent wants to bound *hydration*, it slices client-side
  before calling `items.get`/`users.get`.)

**Bounds and truncation.** Exactly one host call. Output size is whatever the
upstream change window contains.

**Upstream call plan and transformations.**

1. `GET /v0/updates.json` → `{ items, profiles }`.
2. Project `items`→`item_ids`, `profiles`→`profiles` (default each missing array
   to `[]`); compute `actual_counts`. No per-item fetches.

**Branch and error behaviour.**

- Non-2xx or non-object body → `upstream_error`.
- Missing/empty `items` or `profiles` → corresponding `[]`, count `0`. Not an
  error.
- No `validation_error` path (no inputs); no `not_found` (the feed always exists).

**Effect rationale.** `@effect readOnly`, **not** `@idempotent`. Reading the feed
does not advance a cursor, consume an event, mark anything seen, or take a lease
(rules 6–7) — it is a snapshot read. It is not idempotent because the snapshot
changes on essentially every poll, so a prior result cannot substitute for a
refetch (rules 8–9).

**Test grounding (fixtures + host-call assertions).**

- *ok* — fixture `{ "items":[48492315,48492193], "profiles":["brycewray"] }` →
  assert one call `GET hacker-news.firebaseio.com /v0/updates.json`; output
  `item_ids:[48492315,48492193]`, `profiles:["brycewray"]`,
  `actual_counts:{item_ids:2,profiles:1}`.
- *empty arrays* — `{ "items":[], "profiles":[] }` → both `[]`, counts `0`.
- *missing keys* — `{}` → both default to `[]`, counts `0`.
- *upstream_error* — status `500` → `errorContains:"upstream_error"`.
- *no-credentials* — assert no auth header.

**Implementation notes.** Thinnest tool; one `fetchJson` + projection. Deliberately
no hydration so a polling loop stays cheap — the agent decides which changed ids
warrant an `items.get`/`users.get`.

---

### items.recent

**Purpose.** Discover the newest items on Hacker News **of any type** by reading
`maxitem` and walking item ids downward, hydrating up to `limit` live ones.
Covers the count-down discovery alternative in use case #6, and surfaces the
current `max_id` for agents that bookmark a position.

**Use when** the agent wants the raw "what was just created on HN" firehose
(brand-new comments and stories alike), or just the current max item id.

**Do not use when** you want newest *stories* specifically — most brand-new items
are comments, so use `stories.list(kind:"new")` for stories. For
change-monitoring of already-known content, `updates.get` is cheaper and more
targeted. This tool is a creation-order firehose, not a ranked feed.

**Inputs.**

| Name | Type | Default | Validation |
|------|------|---------|------------|
| `limit` | `number` | `10` | Integer `1..30`; else `validation_error`, no host calls. |

**Output.**

```ts
interface RecentItemsResult {
  max_id: number;        // required — the maxitem value observed this call
  requested_limits: {
    limit: number;       // effective limit (1..30)
  };
  actual_counts: {
    scan_budget: number;            // ids the walk may inspect = 2 * limit
    ids_scanned: number;            // ids actually walked downward from max_id
    items_returned: number;         // hydrated live items in `items`
    skipped_deleted_or_dead: number;
    skipped_null: number;
    failed_fetch: number;
  };
  truncated: boolean;    // always true — older items always exist below the window (informational)
  items: Item[];         // up to `limit` canonical Items, newest-first (descending id)
}
```

- **Count invariant:** `ids_scanned = items_returned + skipped_deleted_or_dead +
  skipped_null + failed_fetch`. The `maxitem` lookup is **not** counted (it is the
  root). `ids_scanned <= scan_budget`.
- **Ordering:** strictly descending id (newest first).
- **Max items:** `items.length <= limit <= 30`.
- **`truncated` is always `true`** because `maxitem` only ever grows, so older
  items always exist beneath the returned window — it is informational. To tell
  whether the **request was satisfied**, compare `actual_counts.items_returned`
  with `requested_limits.limit`: equal ⇒ filled; fewer ⇒ the scan budget was
  exhausted by dead/deleted/missing ids before `limit` live items were found.

**Bounds and truncation.** Two bounds prevent runaway fan-out: the `limit` cap
(≤30 returned) and a `scan_budget = 2 * limit` cap on how many ids the walk may
inspect (so a run of deleted ids cannot scan forever). Worst case `1 + 2·30 = 61`
host calls.

**Upstream call plan and transformations.**

1. `GET /v0/maxitem.json` → integer `max_id`. Non-2xx or non-integer →
   `upstream_error`.
2. Walk `id = max_id, max_id-1, …`; for each (until `items_returned == limit` or
   `ids_scanned == scan_budget`): `GET /v0/item/{id}.json`. Classify
   null/deleted-or-dead/non-2xx into the skip/fail buckets; else normalize to
   `Item` and append.
3. Assemble counts; `truncated = true`.

**Branch and error behaviour.**

- Bad `limit` → `validation_error`, zero host calls.
- `maxitem` non-2xx / non-integer → `upstream_error` (root failure; aborts before
  any item fetch).
- Scan budget exhausted before `limit` filled → partial `items`,
  `items_returned < limit`, counts explain why. Not an error.
- Per-item failures → counted, walk continues.

**Test grounding (fixtures + host-call assertions).**

- *ok* — `maxitem` `100`, items `100`/`99` live, `limit:2` → assert call order
  `maxitem.json`, `item/100.json`, `item/99.json`; `items_returned:2`,
  `max_id:100`, items in descending-id order.
- *skips within budget* — `maxitem` `100`, `item/100` `null`, `item/99`
  `{deleted:true}`, `item/98` live, `limit:1` → assert it scans 100→99→98,
  `items_returned:1`, `skipped_null:1`, `skipped_deleted_or_dead:1`.
- *scan-budget exhaustion* — `limit:1` (budget 2) with `item/100` and `item/99`
  both `null` → assert exactly `1 + 2 = 3` calls, `items_returned:0`,
  `ids_scanned:2`, `items` empty.
- *maxitem upstream_error* — `maxitem` status `500` → `errorContains:
  "upstream_error"`, only the `maxitem.json` call made (no item fetches).
- *bad limit* — `limit:0` → `errorContains:"validation_error"`, `calls:[]`.
- *no-credentials* — assert no auth header.

**Implementation notes.** Shares `fetchJson` + `normalizeItem`. The `scan_budget =
2 * limit` heuristic keeps the call count bounded regardless of how many recent
ids are dead/deleted; document it so agents understand why `items_returned` can
be below `limit`. Sequential descending walk keeps host-call order assertable.
